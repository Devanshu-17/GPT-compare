    # What this tool is about?
    This tool is designed to compare, find the usecases of models provided by openai. Thanks for using this tool.

    ## What is openai?
    OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Greg Brockman. It is based in San Francisco, California, and is funded by Musk, Amazon, Microsoft, and other investors. OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. OpenAI's first product is an API that provides access to its GPT-3 language model. The company also develops other AI technologies, such as a robot that can play the video game Dota 2.
